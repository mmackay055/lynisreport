# Lynis Report Tool

This is a tool written in [Go](https://go.dev/) that is used to process the
[Lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis/) auditing tool for Unix system. For now it
will just be used to create summary logs with all the warnings, and suggestions
contained in a JSON string so it can be easily processed by platforms such as
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/), ect.
